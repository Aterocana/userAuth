A Nodejs User Authenticator Demo

In order to use this demo you have to install dependencies with `npm install` from a terminal in the main directory.
You need also to create a file, in the main directory, called dbParam.json with this content:

{	
	"url" : "localhost",
	"port" : 27017,
	"db_name" : "Authentication"
}

where you can configure each parameter adapting it for your mongoDB setup.
